    science: "This transformation was achieved using traditional fixed orthodontics (braces). By carefully calculating the force vectors, we were able to expand the arch and rotate the teeth into their optimal positions. The treatment not only improved aesthetics but also corrected the bite alignment for better long-term oral health."

    science: "We utilized Clear Aligner Therapy (Invisalign) to intrude the posterior teeth and extrude the anterior segment, effectively closing the open bite without surgery. The treatment concluded with a whitening protocol to enhance luminosity, resulting in a balanced, functional, and radiant smile."

    science: "This case demonstrates the power of biomimetic dentistry. We used high-strength composite resins layered to mimic the natural opacity and translucency of dentin and enamel. This 'invisible' restoration preserves the maximum amount of healthy tooth structure while restoring full function and aesthetics."
